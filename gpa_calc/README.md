# Swarthmore College GPA Calculator

A lightweight Flask app for calculating GPAs for Swarthmore College students.
Currently, it requires students to paste transcript data from MySwarthmore into
the input box, but (pending confirmation that it is actually legal) it will
hopefully eventually be able to directly scrape the data from MySwarthmore using
the user's login credentials.
